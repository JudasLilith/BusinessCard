#where can I make my QR code?

-You can make it by pasting on this website: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/

*DISCLAIMER* I haven't tried importing this myself, so use at your own risk!


#alternative method
-Make a new footprint with create footprint
-pick qr code wizard
in the slots that says string value and put your URL inisde the sheet


Personally, I recommend writing a link to your personal github
Or you can make your own website and link it to the qr code


*DISCLAMER* For beginners like me, I really wasn't able to find a way to scale the QR code to the wanted dimensions, so use with risk!

make sure to draw the outlines, or else they look pretty janky!

Have fun building!

Any additions that might look good, you can add an issues for it and I'll review it!
